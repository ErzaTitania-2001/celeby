# celeby - IOT-based Smart Blanket

We propose an Arduino-based artificially warm-able patient mattress which can be used to keep patients warm in presence of the magnetic scanning machines during CT/MRI/PET scan procedures, without hindering their operation. 


Components needed : 

Arduino Uno
Relay (5V) 
Dialpad (4x4)
Thermal Sensor (LM35) 
PVC pipes (underground) 
Capillary Tubes 
Mattress = 
Pump 
Solenoid Coil
Cylindrical Container
