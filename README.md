# celeby - IOT-based Smart Blanket

We propose an Arduino-based artificially warm-able patient mattress which can be used to keep patients warm in presence of the magnetic scanning machines during CT/MRI/PET scan procedures, without hindering their operation. 


Components needed : 

- Arduino Uno
- Relay (5V) 
- Dialpad (4x4)
- Thermal Sensor (LM35) 
- PVC pipes (underground) 
- Capillary Tubes 
- Mattress 
- Pump 
- Solenoid Coil
- Cylindrical Container
